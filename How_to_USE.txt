How to Use the Automatic Trading Bot

1. Clone or Download the Repository
    Click the green Code button in GitHub and copy the HTTPS link.
    Open your terminal (or Anaconda prompt) and run:
   ==> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Trading_Bot.git
    cd Trading_Bot

2. Install Dependencies
    Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    Install the required libraries:
   ==> pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Get API Keys from Exchange
    Create an account on a supported exchange (e.g., Binance, Bybit).
    Go to your exchange dashboard → API Management.
    Generate API Key and Secret Key.
    Copy them and paste into the config.json file in the repo (or directly in code):
  ==> {
       "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
       "secret_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
       "exchange": "binance"
       }
   NOTE:- ⚠️ Never share your API keys publicly!

4. Configure Trading Settings
     Open config.json or the notebook cell where parameters are defined.
     Adjust settings like:
     trading_pair: "BTC/USDT"
     timeframe: "15m"
     risk_per_trade: 0.01 (1% of capital)
     stop_loss and take_profit levels

5. Run Backtesting First (Safe Mode)
     Run the trading_bot.ipynb notebook.
     Select Backtest Mode (uses historical data).
     Check results → profit/loss, win rate, drawdowns.
     If satisfied, move to live trading.

6. Enable Live Trading
     Switch mode to Live Trading in the code/config.
     Start the bot:
  ==> python trading_bot.py
     The bot will now fetch real-time prices, generate buy/sell signals, and place trades automatically.

7. Monitor Logs and Performance
     The bot logs every trade (time, price, PnL).
     Use plotly charts inside the notebook to visualize performance.
     Stop anytime with CTRL + C.


8. SAFETY TIPS
     Always start with a demo account or testnet (Binance Testnet, Bybit Testnet).
     Never trade with large capital until you fully trust the bot.
     Adjust risk management settings before going live.


✅ That’s it! Now even a beginner can run your bot step by step.
